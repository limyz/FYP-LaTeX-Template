# FYP-LaTeX-Template

Template for writing Final Year Project (FYP) projects in LaTeX for Computer Engineering (CEG) students in NUS. This format strictly adheres to the cover page requirements required by the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department.

This template has been heavily modified for use in Overleaf and can be used with Electrical Engineering (EE) FYP reports with considerable modification.

Adapted from [Prof Ooi's Template](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooiwt/latex/socreport) and [quarbby](https://github.com/quarbby).
